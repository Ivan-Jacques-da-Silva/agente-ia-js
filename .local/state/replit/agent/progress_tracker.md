# AI Agent Development Progress Tracker

## Project Goal
Develop an AI Agent system for code development with a professional interface. The system should have three workspaces (frontend, api, agente) and provide real-time analysis steps, version control, and independent chat sessions. Each chat must have its own isolated repository, history, and conversations with visual code comparisons.

## Current Status: ✅ COMPLETED

### Latest Updates - October 11, 2025

#### ✅ Agent Responsiveness Improvements
- **Smart Intent Detection**: Agent now distinguishes between casual conversation and work requests
  - Simple greetings ("Olá", "Oi", "Obrigado") trigger conversational responses without attempting code changes
  - Work requests (even without explicit action verbs) properly route to the change-generation pipeline
  - Exact matching with length guards prevents false positives on legitimate coding prompts
- **Removed Blocking Overlay**: Eliminated the full-screen loading overlay that blocked UI interaction
  - Users can now navigate and interact with the interface while agent processes requests
  - Progress steps remain visible in the chat stream via SSE
  - Better user experience with non-intrusive loading indicators

### Updates - October 10, 2025

#### ✅ Complete Chat Isolation System
- **Chat Session Management**: Each chat now maintains completely independent:
  - Repository/Project (projeto)
  - File tree (arvore)  
  - History (historico)
  - Messages and conversations
- **Smart State Switching**: Automatically loads chat-specific data when switching between chats
- **Persistent Storage**: All chat sessions saved to localStorage with full context

#### ✅ Visual History with Code Comparison
- **HistoricoItem Component**: Professional history cards showing:
  - Icon indicators for different event types (📁 projeto, ✅ mudança aprovada, etc.)
  - Expandable details with before/after code preview
  - Side-by-side code comparison view
  - Copy buttons for both original and new code versions
- **Full Diff Viewer Integration**: Button to open complete VSCode-style diff comparison
- **Backend Enhancement**: Stores complete change data (original code, new code, diff) in history

#### ✅ Real-Time Streaming Architecture  
- **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: Live streaming of agent analysis steps
- **Analysis Progress Display**: Shows autonomous thinking process in real-time
- **Chat-Based Updates**: All changes appear directly in chat with visual diffs

#### ✅ Version Control & History
- **Database-Backed History**: Complete tracking of all project events
- **Revert Functionality**: Can rollback to any previous version
- **Visual Comparisons**: Before/after code views with copy functionality

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
```
Frontend (React) ─── Port 5000 ─── User Interface
    ├── Chat isolation with independent project contexts
    ├── Real-time SSE streaming display
    ├── Visual history with diff viewer
    └── Side-by-side code comparison
    
API Server ─── Port 5050 ─── API Gateway

Agent Server ─── Port 6060 ─── Core Logic
    ├── SQLite database for history/chat persistence
    ├── File system operations with full tracking
    ├── SSE streaming for analysis steps
    └── Complete change data storage
```

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Chat Isolation System
- Each chat has independent `projeto`, `arvore`, `historico`
- Automatic context switching on chat change
- Data persisted in chatSessions state and localStorage

#### 2. Visual History Component
- Professional card design with icons
- Expandable code previews (original vs new)
- Copy functionality for any code version
- Integration with full diff viewer

#### 3. Real-Time Analysis Streaming
- SSE-based streaming of agent thoughts
- Progress indicators showing current analysis step
- Autonomous, human-like display of work

#### 4. Enhanced Data Storage
- History now stores complete change objects:
  ```json
  {
    "arquivo": "path/to/file",
    "conteudo_original": "...",
    "conteudo_novo": "...",
    "diff": "..."
  }
  ```

## Files Modified/Created

### Frontend
- `front/src/app.jsx` - Main app with chat isolation logic
- `front/src/HistoricoItem.jsx` - Visual history component (NEW)
- `front/src/MudancaCard.jsx` - Change display cards
- `front/src/chat-utils.js` - Streaming and diff utilities
